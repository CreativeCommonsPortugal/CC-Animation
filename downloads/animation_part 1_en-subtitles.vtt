00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey there!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Are you an artist, author, creator or a cultural worker?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you are, you probably heard about copyright before

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but you might still not really understand it very well...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Perhaps we can help with that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Here we'll show you how copyright affects cultural and creative work

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
and how you can handle it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So first, let's be clear about what we mean 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
by Cultural and Creative Work.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
Studies show that if you are an artist or a cultural worker

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000
you like to dare, try new things,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.900
you have a risky, artistic spirit

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and the creative act is essential to you.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000
You see your work as a positive activity that you enjoy,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
rather than something you HAVE to do to earn money.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Creative work is not just about financial income

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.500
it involves other types of rewards, such as

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.500
the autonomy to manage your time

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or the freedom to make your own choices.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You probably are highly educated

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
unfortunately this usually has little influence

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
on your creative career.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You most likely work part time

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and may hold multiple jobs to complement

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the low and uncertain income

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
from your artistic work.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And like you,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
there are a lot of other creators

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
-maybe too many for the market-

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
so there's a lot for audiences and clients

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to choose from. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And as work supply increases

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.500
payments tend to fall.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.000
Finally, to develop a strong creative career,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you need to meet the right people

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
who can help you gain a good reputation.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Those networks also influence

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.000
your artistic practice somehow,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so you usually need to be very flexible and adaptable.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So although cultural and creative work

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
might be seen as a positive kind of work,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
it also results in a lot of uncertainty.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Only very few creators and cultural workers

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
manage to reach the spotlight and become

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so-called superstars.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
And, once they do,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.500
their work becomes more of a response to market pressures

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
than the result of artistic inspiration.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.000
But what's copyright got to do with this?
