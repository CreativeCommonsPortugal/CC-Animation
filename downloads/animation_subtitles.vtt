00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey there!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Are you an artist, author, creator or a cultural worker?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you are, you probably heard about copyright before

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but you might still not really understand it very well…

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Perhaps we can help with that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Here we’ll show you how copyright affects cultural and creative work

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
and how you can handle it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So first, let's be clear about what we mean 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
by Cultural and Creative Work.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
Studies show that if you are an artist or a cultural worker

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000
you like to dare, try new things,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.900
you have a risky, artistic spirit

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and the creative act is essential to you.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000
You see your work as a positive activity that you enjoy,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
rather than something you HAVE to do to earn money.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Creative work is not just about financial income

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.500
it involves other types of rewards, such as

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.500
the autonomy to manage your time

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or the freedom to make your own choices.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You probably are highly educated

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
unfortunately this usually has little influence

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
on your creative career.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You most likely work part time

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and may hold multiple jobs to complement

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the low and uncertain income

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
from your artistic work.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And like you,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
there are a lot of other creators

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
—maybe too many for the market—

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
so there’s a lot for audiences and clients

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to choose from. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And as work supply increases

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.500
payments tend to fall.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.000
Finally, to develop a strong creative career,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you need to meet the right people

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
who can help you gain a good reputation.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Those networks also influence

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.000
your artistic practice somehow,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so you usually need to be very flexible and adaptable.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So although cultural and creative work

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
might be seen as a positive kind of work,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
it also results in a lot of uncertainty.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Only very few creators and cultural workers

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
manage to reach the spotlight and become

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so-called superstars.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
And, once they do,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.500
their work becomes more of a response to market pressures

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
than the result of artistic inspiration.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.000
But what’s copyright got to do with this?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.000
Copyright is a set of laws

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that protects different kinds of intellectual creation.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Since the 18th century, it keeps a balance

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
between private incentive for creation

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and public access.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Copyright protects the authors by making sure

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.500
they get compensation for their artistic,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.000
literary or scientific work 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
for a certain period of time,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
after which the work falls into public domain.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But recently copyright extension and scope

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
have become stronger and more complex.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Also, the different territorial characteristics of copyright laws

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
make it difficult to negotiate between countries.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And this is why,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.500
in the creative economy,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.000
a set of laws originally designed to protect authors

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
has turned more into a sort of currency.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So... how does copyright affect the cultural sector?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Consider this graphic explanation:

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Right in the middle,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
there are the original authors, the core creators.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Around them:

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the producers,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
agents,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
programmers

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and distributors.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
These intermediaries assist you in your creative work,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
helping you make it possible

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and improving the way you reach your audience,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
without having to bother with tasks you often don’t like

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
or don’t know how to do. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.500
Sometimes creators themselves accumulate these functions.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.000
You might find an artist who is also a producer,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
an actress that is also her own agent… 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but hardly the creator becomes a distributor.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And when they are, that means they probably became

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.500
superstars somewhere along the way…

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500
This means that, in general,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.000
core creators exchange their copyrights

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
for those intermediary services.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Because of their low income

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
they usually have a weak bargaining power

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
thus ending up with the smallest (if any)

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
chunk of revenues generated by their own creations. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.500
Recalling the excessive supply of creative workers,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.000
we can see that there are far more creators,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
producers, agents or even programmers

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
when compared to distributors.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
However, it’s this thin layer of distributors

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that has more power to enforce copyright and control revenues…

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This means that, instead of protecting authors,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
copyright has mostly been used by major businesses

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
to control cultural production

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and who can have access to it.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So, are artists condemned to be either

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
under-recognized, poor workers

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.500
or rich, powerful superstars? 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.000
No. 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.000
Between the mainstream approach

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.000
of taking a defensive position towards copyright

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.500
and the opposite possibility of dedicating

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.000
all your work to public domain,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
there are many options.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You can opt for a more or less loose strategy.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
There are no secret formulas

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and no guarantee that one strategy

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
is more efficient than the other. 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You can always combine both

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
protective and open positions,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
depending on the project and actors at stake.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
What is important to understand is that

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
you can set the rules of your own game.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And this is where open licenses can help.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
(Wait.) What are open licenses?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
For those of you who don’t know,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
open licenses are agreements

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
which allow artists to set permissions

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
for others to use their creative work.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.500
Creative Commons are a set of open licenses that fill a gap

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.000
between copyright’s automatic “all rights reserved”

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and public domain’s “no rights reserved”,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
granting a certain autonomy for artists

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
to decide in what terms

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
they want their work to circulate. 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.000
Creative Commons offers free, ready to use options

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
to license your work and it is up to you

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to decide which ones to use. 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
But… How does that  help my creative career?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
As we have seen

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
recognition, networks, time and artistic freedom

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
are worthy and interchangeable values

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
for you to consider.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But if you also want your creative work

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
to be sustainable and have a positive impact

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
for you and those who you work with,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
always protecting your copyright

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
is NOT the only way to go.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Here are some strategies to manage the value

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
of your work with open licenses 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Distributing your work with an open license

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
can help you reach larger audiences within a low budget,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and even achieve possible professional opportunities.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
By sharing some of your work for free,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
you can attract clients for other services

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
or products you also develop.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You can generate revenues through other indirect ways,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
such as advertising, partnerships or consultancy

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
People may have access to samples

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
or beta versions of your work

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and help you improve it,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
getting a discount for their contribution

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
in the final product.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And by creating a community around your service

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
you can make your work grow bigger and trustful

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
improving your reputation. 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
As you can see, there are lots of possibilities

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
you only need to be creative about the strategies you choose.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Creative Commons helps you promote this transparent mindset

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of sharing and referencing the people and work you love!

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
(Now) Think of your own projects today.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Can you hold them in the long run?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Are they generating the value you expected

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
for everyone, including yourself?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Are they sustainable?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
It is up to you to decide

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
what to do with your own copyright

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
how you want to manage it

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and in what terms you want to share your work. 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Strategies, rules, agreements and laws

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
are defined by and for people.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And the way you set your own terms

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
has an impact in the world.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, now that you know a bit more about

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
how copyright influences your creative life… 

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
what role do you want to play

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
in the cultural scene?
