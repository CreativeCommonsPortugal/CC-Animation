00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
Between the mainstream approach

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of taking a defensive position towards copyright

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.500
and the opposite possibility of dedicating

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.000
all your work to public domain,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
there are many options.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You can opt for a more or less loose strategy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are no secret formulas

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and no guarantee that one strategy

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is more efficient than the other. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You can always combine both

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
protective and open positions,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
depending on the project and actors at stake.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What is important to understand is that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you can set the rules of your own game.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And this is where open licenses can help.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
(Wait.) What are open licenses?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
For those of you who don't know,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
open licenses are agreements

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which allow artists to set permissions

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
for others to use their creative work.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.500
Creative Commons are a set of open licenses that fill a gap

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.000
between copyright's automatic "all rights reserved"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and public domain's "no rights reserved",

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
granting a certain autonomy for artists

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to decide in what terms

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
they want their work to circulate. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.000
Creative Commons offers free, ready to use options

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to license your work and it is up to you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to decide which ones to use. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But, How does that  help my creative career?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
As we have seen

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
recognition, networks, time and artistic freedom

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
are worthy and interchangeable values

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
for you to consider.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But if you also want your creative work

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to be sustainable and have a positive impact

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
for you and those who you work with,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
always protecting your copyright

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is NOT the only way to go.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Here are some strategies to manage the value

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
of your work with open licenses 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Distributing your work with an open license

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
can help you reach larger audiences within a low budget,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and even achieve possible professional opportunities.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
By sharing some of your work for free,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you can attract clients for other services

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
or products you also develop.

00:02:05.000--> 00:02:07.000
You can generate revenues through other indirect ways,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
such as advertising, partnerships or consultancy

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
People may have access to samples

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000 
or beta versions of your work

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000 
and help you improve it,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
getting a discount for their contribution

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000 
in the final product.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000 
And by creating a community around your service

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000 
you can make your work grow bigger and trustful

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000 
improving your reputation. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000 
As you can see, there are lots of possibilities

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000 
you only need to be creative about the strategies you choose.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000 
Creative Commons helps you promote this transparent mindset

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000 
of sharing and referencing the people and work you love!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000 
(Now) Think of your own projects today.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000 
Can you hold them in the long run?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000 
Are they generating the value you expected

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000 
for everyone, including yourself?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000 
Are they sustainable?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It is up to you to decide

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000 
what to do with your own copyright

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000 
how you want to manage it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000 
and in what terms you want to share your work. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000 
Strategies, rules, agreements and laws

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 
are defined by and for people.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000 
And the way you set your own terms

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000 
has an impact in the world.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000 
So, now that you know a bit more about

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000 
how copyright influences your creative life... 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000 
what role do you want to play

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000 
in the cultural scene?
