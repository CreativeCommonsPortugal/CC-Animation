00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Copyright is a set of laws

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that protects different kinds of intellectual creation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Since the 18th century, it keeps a balance

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
between private incentive for creation

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000 
and public access.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Copyright protects the authors by making sure

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
they get compensation for their artistic,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
literary or scientific work 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for a certain period of time,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
after which the work falls into public domain.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But recently copyright extension and scope

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
have become stronger and more complex.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Also, the different territorial characteristics of copyright laws

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
make it difficult to negotiate between countries.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And this is why,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
in the creative economy,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000
a set of laws originally designed to protect authors

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
has turned more into a sort of currency.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So... how does copyright affect the cultural sector?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Consider this graphic explanation:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Right in the middle,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
there are the original authors, the core creators.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Around them:

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the producers,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
agents,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
programmers

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and distributors.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
These intermediaries assist you in your creative work,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
helping you make it possible

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and improving the way you reach your audience,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
without having to bother with tasks you often don't like

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or don't know how to do. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Sometimes creators themselves accumulate these functions.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
You might find an artist who is also a producer,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
an actress that is also her own agent... 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but hardly the creator becomes a distributor.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And when they are, that means they probably became

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.500
superstars somewhere along the way...

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
This means that, in general,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.000
core creators exchange their copyrights

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
for those intermediary services.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Because of their low income

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
they usually have a weak bargaining power

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
thus ending up with the smallest (if any)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
chunk of revenues generated by their own creations. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.500
Recalling the excessive supply of creative workers,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.000
we can see that there are far more creators,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
producers, agents or even programmers

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
when compared to distributors.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
However, it's this thin layer of distributors

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that has more power to enforce copyright and control revenues...

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This means that, instead of protecting authors,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
copyright has mostly been used by major businesses

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to control cultural production

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and who can have access to it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So, are artists condemned to be either

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
under-recognized, poor workers

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.500
or rich, powerful superstars? 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.000
No.
